              Repatriation: An Approach For A Fairer Museum, MS Thesis 2019
            </h4>
            <p>
              Museums are bastions of culture, they hold artifacts from all over
              the world. These artifacts hold different meanings to different
              people and some want their artifacts repatriated. Repatriation is
              defined as: “the restoration of something to its rightful owner.”
              This visualization proposes a framework to determine the
              suitability of repatriation of an artifact or art piece. It also
              maps repatriation cases worldwide and applies the framework to a
              sample of the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

            <h4>The Changing Language of Facebook’s Terms of Service</h4>
            <p>
              Using Basil.js, this static visualization explores the evolution
              of Facebook’s Terms of Service. The first is from November 2007
              and the second is from March 2019. It investigates the language
              used, and any changes made, frequently used terms, linked terms,
              the ambiguity of data handling and technological changes within
              the terms. Published in Dark Data, Critical investigations on
              surveillance, privacy, and power.

            <h4>UNDP RBA Renewable Energy Project Partnership</h4>
            <p>
              Through the lens of SDG-5 (Gender Equality), this visualization
              examines the importance of dependable energy in healthcare
              facilities and its role in reproductive care in sub-Saharan
              Africa. It also explores the direct correlation between maternal
              mortality rates and a lack of electricity in healthcare facilities
              in sub-Saharan Africa. Without dependable energy in healthcare
              facilities, women experience a range of complications including
              but not limited to, giving birth in the dark without access to
              facilities with electricity and lifesaving devices requiring
              energy. Initiatives that focus on investing in dependable energy
              in this area will have a direct impact in saving women's lives.

            <p>
              The following is a map of AA meetings in Manhattan in a given
              year. The process to get to the end result is as such: scrapping
              all information from the AA website. Storing meeting information
              in a ProgreSQL server and using the pg module in Node as well as a
              Leaflet overlay to create the front-end.
