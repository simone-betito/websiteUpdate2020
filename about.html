      <p>
        Simone Betito is a Data Visualization Developer at Girl Scouts and a
        Master of Science graduate in Data Visualization from Parsons School of
        Design (The New School). She also holds a Bachelor of Commerce from
        Ryerson University. She has a penchant for arts, design and is currently
        building her path in the growing field of Data Visualization and
        Infographics. She is passionate about the ability to combine her love
        for analyzing key trends in data with her partiality for creativity and
        visual elements. She's also a fervent advocate for women in STEM fields
        and continues to volunteer her time with organizations who champion
        this.

      <p>
        On the side, Simone also provides data visualization and analytics
        consulting for small businesses, non-profits, research reports and
        scholarly theses, technology firms, retail, journalists and small
        business design projects. Simone enjoys a good Baroque painting and has
        mixed feelings about pie charts.
